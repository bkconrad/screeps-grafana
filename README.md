# screeps-grafana

Pretty graphs for Screeps stats. There are two ways to get started:

## Path 1: Easy but not robust
You can run this project locally, with all the drawbacks that entails.

Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Copy and edit the example config file:

```
cp docker-compose.env.example docker-compose.env
$EDITOR docker-compose.env
```

Run the docker thing:

```
docker-compose up
```

Go to http://localhost:1337 in your browser, then see SETUP below.

## Path 2: Robust but not easy

Acquire a server, I use a t2.micro from Amazon Web Services. You can use anything running ubuntu with passwordless sudo.

Open ports 80 and 81 in your security groups.

***SUPER IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE TO MOUNT A DATA VOLUME TO /dev/sdf IN THE AWS CONSOLE. IF YOU FAIL TO DO SO, YOUR DATA AND DASHBOARDS WILL BE LOST IF THE SERVER RESTARTS, THEN YOU WILL BE HELLA SALTY, AND I'LL JUST CROSS MY ARMS AND SAY "I TOLD YOU SO IN BOLDED ITALICS"***

Install [ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html).

Create a password for your screeps account if you haven't already.

You're now ready to run this whale of a command. Replace the stuff in caps with values that makes sense

```
ansible-playbook \
  -e screeps_username=YOURUSERNAME \
  -e screeps_password=YOURPASSWORD \
  -e screeps_email=YOUREMAIL \
  --user ubuntu \
  --private-key YOURPRIVATEKEY \
  -i ,YOURSERVERIP \
  playbook.yml
```

**Don't remove the comma before `YOURSERVERIP`. You will get a mysterious error. If you pass your IP like `,12.34.56.78` you are doing it correctly.**

If the run errors out, check your parameters and retry. It is common to see transient errors from Apt or GPG, which are both fixed by re-running.

You are now ready to Setup

## Setup

Got to http://localhost:1337 or your own real-life server's IP. Login with the following default credentials:

```
username: admin
password: admin
```

*THIS NEXT STEP IS VERY IMPORTANT, AND IF YOU SKIP IT NOTHING WILL SEEM TO WORK*

Add graphite as a data source by going to Data Sources -> Add New, then entering the following Url under Http settings:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

Click Add. You are now ready to [create some dashboards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUvJamHeMpw).

To send stats to the dashboard, simply write them to `Memory.stats`. For example:

```
Memory.stats["room." + room.name + ".energyAvailable"] = room.energyAvailable;
Memory.stats["room." + room.name + ".energyCapacityAvailable"] = room.energyCapacityAvailable;
Memory.stats["room." + room.name + ".controllerProgress"] = room.controller.progress;
```

All values on the `Memory.stats` object are forwarded to Grafana verbatim.
